This is the software archive repo for the Imperial Meng Project:\
Counterfactuals: The impact of image properties on the quality of generated explanations in XAI - Daniel Nguyen


GANterfactual folder contains the main CycleGAN used to train and generate counterfactuals based off [Mertes et al's work](https://github.com/hcmlab/GANterfactual) with some extra modificatons to the CycleGAN method to get the accuracy and MAE metrics easier along with being able to train with several types of models\
Models contain the scripts that were used to create and train the model\
Synthetic datasets contain scripts that were used to make the synthetic datasets listed in the report\
3D GAN contains the 3D implementation of the original GANterfactual method as well as how to make + view the 3D dataset

Other datasets used will be linked below:\
[RSNA Pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge)\
[Diabetic Retinopathy](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection)\
[Retinal OCT](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2)
